    <h2>Version Control System | Git vs GitHub</h2>

    <div>
      <h3>What is Version Control System?</h3>
      <p>
        Version Control System is a kind of database. It lets you save a project
        snapshot at any time.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>Every change made to the project files is tracked, along with-</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who made the change.</li>
          <li>Why the change was made.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Later, the Version Control System shows exactly how an older version
        differs from the previous one.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Why version control system is needed?</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>1. Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          Without a version control system, developers working on the same
          project from different regions will struggle to collaborate.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Storing Versions</h4>
        <p>
          Managing multiple project versions on your disk can be challenging due
          to the large amount of data to store and organize.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Restoring Previous Versions</h4>
        <p>
          Version control systems let developers revert to a previous working
          version if mistakes occur.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Backup</h4>
        <p>
          If the system or disk fails without a backup, all files will be lost,
          so a version control system is essential.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Types of version control system</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Local version control system</li>
        <li>Central version control system</li>
        <li>Distributed version control system</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>What is Git?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Git is a popular distributed version control system for software
          development.
        </li>
        <li>It enables developers to collaborate on a project.</li>
        <li>Can efficiently track and manage code changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>How Git works?</h3>
      <p>
        Git stores data as snapshots of a mini filesystem. With each commit, it
        captures the current state of your files and saves a reference.
      </p>
      <h4>A Git project has three sections-</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Working Directory (a single version checkout).</li>
        <li>Staging Area (index for the next commit).</li>
        <li>Git Repository (stores metadata and object database).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
      <p>
        GitHub is a web platform for hosting projects using Git version control.
      </p>
    </div>
